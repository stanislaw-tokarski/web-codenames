# Codenames
Web version of the _Codenames_ board game by Vlaada Chv√°til.

All rights to the game logic belongs to the author of its board version. I do not have any profits from the development of this implementation. The project was created during the coronavirus epidemic to allow online gameplay obeying the #stayhome principle.

To run the project, simply execute:

````
mvn clean install spring-boot:run
````
